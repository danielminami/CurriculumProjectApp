# Curriculum Project App
This APP has been developed for learning purposes. 

## Technology
I've decided to use Android Studio to build an Native Android APP. I've managed to explore:  
  - Layouts
  - Drawable Menu
  - Intents
  - Activities
  - Fragments
  - Restful API Consuming through Retrofit2
  - Recycler View

## Version
The current version of the application is 1.0.3 and it is published at Google Play:
